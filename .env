The task is to configure .env files and sensitive variables for the project
Looking at the environment details, I see this is a full-stack project with backend (Node.js) and frontend (React/Vite) directories
Currently there are no .env files present in either directory
The backend uses Node.js (package.json/server.js) and likely needs database/config variables
The frontend uses React/Vite and may need API keys or endpoints
Since there are more than 10 files, I'll use search_code to find any existing environment variable usage
